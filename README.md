# Coffee Donor ☕🩸

Small personal Flutter app that helps Latvian blood donors quickly generate and store Narvesen
coffee coupons after donation.

> ⚠️ This is a **personal pet project** for my own use and Dart/Flutter practice.  
> It is not affiliated with Narvesen, any blood donation center, or any other organization.

## What the app does

After donating blood in Latvia, you can get a Narvesen coffee coupon via a link and an e-mail
address.  
Normally it works like this:

- You scan a QR code after donation.
- You enter an e-mail.
- The system sends you a coupon.
- Each e-mail usually gets **one specific coupon**, and reusing the same e-mail will usually resend
  the same coupon.

This app:

- Automates the process of **getting a new coupon** after donation.
- Stores your coupons locally (available / used).
- Helps you not lose the coupon and quickly find it later.
- Has some helpers for working with e-mails (including Gmail aliases).

The main goal is to remove repetitive manual steps for a **frequent donor** and to have some fun
writing Dart/Flutter code.

## Requirements

- Flutter (stable channel) installed
- Android SDK + Android Studio / command line tools
- Java (via Android Studio is enough)

The app targets **Android** only.  
If you want iOS – feel free to pay Apple for the Developer Program and wire it up yourself. 🙂

## Setup & Run on Android

### 1. Install dependencies

From the project root:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Generate JSON serialization code

The project uses `json_serializable` / `build_runner` for `*.g.dart` files.

Generate once:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### 3. Generate launcher icons & splash screen

Icons are generated by `flutter_launcher_icons`, splash by `flutter_native_splash`.

**Generate launcher icons:**

```bash
dart run flutter_launcher_icons
```

**Generate native splash:**

```bash
dart run flutter_native_splash:create
```

Run these again if you change the icon or splash assets/config.

### 4. Run on device / emulator (debug)

Connect an Android device with USB debugging enabled or start an emulator, then:

```bash
flutter run
```

This builds and launches a debug build of the app.

## Build a release APK (Android)

1. (Optionally) configure signing for a proper release build:
   Flutter
   docs: [https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android)

   For quick local use you can also just install the unsigned debug APK on your own device.

2. Build a release APK:

   ```bash
   flutter build apk --release
   ```

3. The output will be here:

   ```text
   build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
   ```

4. Copy/install this APK to your phone (ADB, file transfer, etc.) and install it manually.

## Project notes

* Written in **Dart + Flutter**.
* Uses:

    * local SQLite DB (via `sqflite`) to store coupons and e-mail metadata,
    * simple job runner to fetch coupons in background,
    * some basic settings (remember e-mail, showing used coupons, etc.).
* All logic is optimized for **my own donor flow in Latvia**

## Disclaimer

- The app is intended **only for personal use** after you have actually donated blood.
- You are solely responsible for how you use it.
- There is no guarantee that:
    - the external services won’t change,
    - Narvesen / blood donation center won’t change the coupon rules,
    - the app will keep working in the future.
- Use it at your own risk.  
  I am not responsible for:
    - blocked e-mails,
    - invalid coupons,
    - policy changes,
    - or any other consequences of using this app.

If the official rules or terms say something different, **they win, not this app**.

## Legal / ethics note

* The app **does not hack** or bypass security; it only automates what you can do manually:

    * open the official link,
    * enter an e-mail,
    * receive a coupon.
* There is no explicit statement in the donor flow UI that you may only ever use one e-mail once,
  but:

    * services may still monitor abuse,
    * they may change behavior at any time.
* Please be reasonable:
  the whole idea is “you donated blood → you get a coffee”, not “infinite free coffee”.

## Why this exists

* I donate blood regularly and was tired of repeating the same manual steps.
* I wanted a small project to practice in mobile app development.

If you find this code useful as an example or template for your own experiments – great.
Just remember: **it’s a pet project, not a product.**
